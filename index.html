            <h1>Snow leopard</h1>
            <h3>This article is about the cat. For other uses, see Snow Leopard (disambiguation).</h3>
            <p>The snow leopard (Panthera uncia), occasionally called ounce, 
                is a species of large cat in the genus Panthera of the family 
                Felidae. The species is native to the mountain ranges of Central
                and South Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List 
                because the global population is estimated to number fewer than 
                10,000 mature individuals and is expected to decline about 10% by 
                2040. It is mainly threatened by poaching and habitat destruction
                following infrastructural developments. It inhabits alpine and 
                subalpine zones at elevations of 3,000–4,500 m (9,800–14,800 ft), 
                ranging from eastern Afghanistan, the Himalayas and the Tibetan
                Plateau to southern Siberia, Mongolia and western China. In the
                northern part of its range, it also lives at lower elevations.
                Taxonomically, the snow leopard was long classified in the monotypic
                genus Uncia. Since phylogenetic studies revealed the relationships 
                among Panthera species, it has since been considered a member of
                that genus. Two subspecies were described based on morphological 
                differences, but genetic differences between the two have not yet
                been confirmed. It is therefore regarded as a monotypic species.
                The species is widely depicted in Kyrgyz culture.</p>

        <h1>Naming and etymology</h1>
        <p>The Old French word once, which was intended to be used for the Eurasian
            lynx (Lynx lynx), is where the Latin name uncia and the English word 
            ounce both originate. Once is believed to have originated from a previous
             form of the word lynx through a process known as false splitting. The 
             word once was originally considered to be pronounced as l'once, where 
             l' stands for the elided form of the word la ('the') in French. Once 
             was then understood to be the name of the animal.[2] The word panther 
             derives from the classical Latin panthēra, itself from the ancient Greek
              πάνθηρ pánthēr, which was used for spotted cats.

            Taxonomy and evolution
        </h1>
        <p>Felis uncia was the scientific name used by Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber
             in 1777 who described a snow leopard based on an earlier description by Georges-Louis 
             Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, assuming that the cat occurred along the Barbary Coast,
              in Persia, East India and China.[4] The genus name Uncia was proposed by John 
              Edward Gray in 1854 for Asian cats with a long and thick tail.[5] Felis irbis,
               proposed by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1830, was a skin of a female snow
                leopard collected in the Altai Mountains. He also clarified that several 
                leopard (P. pardus) skins were previously misidentified as snow leopard skins.
                [6] Felis uncioides proposed by Thomas Horsfield in 1855 was a snow leopard 
                skin from Nepal in the collection of the Museum of the East India Company.[7]
                Uncia uncia was used by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1930 when he reviewed skins 
                and skulls of Panthera species from Asia. He also described morphological 
                differences between snow leopard and leopard skins.[8] Panthera baikalensis
                -romanii proposed by a Russian scientist in 2000 was a dark brown snow leopard
                 skin from the Petrovsk-Zabaykalsky District in southern Transbaikal.[9]The snow 
                 leopard was long classified in the monotypic genus Uncia.[10] They were 
                 subordinated to the genus Panthera based on results of phylogenetic studies.
                 [11][12][13][14]
                 Until spring 2017, there was no evidence available for the recognition
                  of subspecies. Results of a phylogeographic analysis indicate that three 
                  subspecies should be recognised:[15]
            
            P. u. uncia in the range countries of the Pamir Mountains
            P. u. irbis in Mongolia, and
            P. u. uncioides in the Himalayas and Qinghai.
            This view has been both contested and supported by different researchers.[16][17][18][19]
            
            Additionally, an extinct subspecies Panthera uncia pyrenaica was described in 2022
             based on material found in France. Its fossil was dated to the early Middle Pleistocene, 
             around 0.57 to 0.53 million years ago.</p>
